# Regression-Project-Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
The Bangalore House Price Dataset is taken from kaggle source. The data set is all about flat housing property and its features. The most tedious task in this dataset was data cleaning. It took lot of time and good logics to be resolved and get the optimized dataset. Else the another tasks of One Hot Encoding, Model Building are more of self-explanatory, if your basics are good and you know something about it before reading this project. In the end using GridSearchCV, I have tested the accuracy of model with comparing with one another model and then predicted the prices of properties/houses on the basis of some features. I hope you will enjoy it! Happy Learning!
